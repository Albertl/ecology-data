#### Learning Objectives

> Following this assignment students should be able to:
>
> - use and create vectorized functions
> - use the apply family of functions for iteration
> - integrate custom functions with dplyr for iteration
> - practice basic syntax and usage of `for` loops
> - use `for` loops to automate function operations 
> - understand how to decompose complex problems



Note that you can CHOOSE one of the last two exercises (#4 or #5). I recommend #4 if you are new to for loops, or #5 if you want a challenge.

Place this code at the start of the assignment to load all the required packages.

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
