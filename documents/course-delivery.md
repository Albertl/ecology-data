### Flipped Classroom

I use a flipped, learner-centered, approach to teach this course, because I 
think that learning to program has very little to do with me talking and a lot 
to do with students working on computers. Flipped classes work well for all 
kinds of content, but I think they work particularly well for computer oriented 
classes. If you're interested in knowing more take a look at this great

### Workshop In-class Format

I've found that some students require a little more motivation of the concepts and strategies than just the `readings/` to complete the `assignments/`, so in some cases I include a brief lecture-style introduction or work through a problem as an example. I disperse my front-of-the-room `material/` into `exercise/`-level chunks for concepts that are sequential in nature.
