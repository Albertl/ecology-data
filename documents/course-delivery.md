### Flipped Classroom

This course uses a flipped, learner-centered, approach because learning to 
program is most effective when students are actively working with computers. 
Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but they work particularly 
well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in knowing more take a 
look at this great info-graphic:

### Workshop In-class Format

While this course is designed as a flipped classroom, some motivation and re-
exposure to the ideas from the `readings/` is beneficial. In some cases, 
multiple key topics are more effectively introduced separately, where a brief 
introduction to one of the key topics is followed by the students completing an 
`exercise/` on that topic. Depending on the length of the `assignment/` and 
class session this could be repeated 2-3 times to cover that many key topics. 
Recommended structure for this strategy is included for some lessons in 
`material/`.
