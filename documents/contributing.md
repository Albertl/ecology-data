# Providing feedback

[Provide feedback](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/issues/new) by opening a new issue at the 'Data Carpentry for Biologists' repository on GitHub (*You'll have to be logged into GitHub*). Please, provide a clear description of your question, comment, or proposed change in the `Title` section and use the `Leave a comment` section for further detail or discussion. Select `Submit new issue` and the repository maintainers will be notified of your feedback. Thanks!


# Contributing New Material

Data Carpentry for Biologists is an open source project, and we welcome 
contributions of all kinds: new and improved lessons, bug reports, and small 
fixes to existing material are all useful. We use standard [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so
fork the repository, add or change material, and submit a pull request.

* From GitHub.com

* From a local GitHub repository 
   1. [Fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the  
[`datacarpentry/semester-biology` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology).
   2. Create a branch from `gh-pages` for your changes. Give your branch a 
      meaningful name, such as `fix-typos-in-select-query` or `add-groupby`.
   4. Make your changes, [commit them, and push them to your repository on  GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change).
   5.  Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository

* If it is easier for you to send them to us some other way, please mail us at 
_LINK TO EMAIL_. Given a choice between you creating content or wrestling with 
Git, we'd rather have you doing the former.

Course materials are managed on GitHub to facilitate collaboration on
developing this kind of material for university courses. The central component
of a flipped computing course is the exercises, so one of the primary form of
contribution will likely be adding exercises to the pool of exercises. 
Individual instructors can then select from a rich pool of exercises the ones 
that fit the topics, languages, and scientific domains that best fit the 
material they want to cover in the course.

There are lots of great resources for being introduced to the individual
concepts being taught in courses like this. Our philosophy is to use and improve
these external resources when available instead of creating new versions of the
same content. In particularly we actively use
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/lessons) and
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) workshop
materials. However, in cases where the necessary material doesn't exist
elsewhere it can certainly be added here.

By contributing, you are agreeing that Data Carpentry may redistribute your work
under [these licenses](LICENSE.md).

# Locations and Formats

Core teaching materials are stored in the relevant folders including
`lectures/`, 'ipynbs/' (a series of Project Jupyter notebooks), and `readings/`.

Class specific materials are stored in `assignments/`, `exercises/` and `solutions/`. Additional files are stored in `data/` and `code/`.

Most of the other folders and files support creating the course website using
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

All web content files are written in Markdown. More details about formats and style used for the website are outlined for [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/manage-assignments), [exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/manage-exercises), and [general style]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/style-guide).
