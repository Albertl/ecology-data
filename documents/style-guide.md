- Do NOT leave extra whitespace, unless required to properly format the markdown rendering.

- Use leading `#` for headers (`# Heading 1`). Most headers in the website content will be `###` or `####`.

- Use `-` for unordered lists. Only use ordered lists if instructions, items, or tasks are sequential in execution.

- Use backticks `\`` to denote code and objects according to their structure:
   - `packages`, `objects` and `lists`
   - `functions()`
   - `directories/`
   - `output-files.txt`
   - `"characters"`

- Encase any hint, note, or () statement with \* to italicize text (*like this*).
