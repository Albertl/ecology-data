*UNDER CONSTRUCTION: Lecture materials for Git, R, and SQL were used for instruction of the pilot run of Data Carpentry for Biologists at the University of Florida Fall 2015. These lecture materials still require review to be sure the content is clear for other instructors seeking to use the materials. Python materials were used in previous iterations of the course at Utah State University, but have not been organized for this lecture structure.*
