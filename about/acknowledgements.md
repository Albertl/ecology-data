#### Funding

The development of this course, and this site, have been supported by an [NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694) and by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through grants [GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855) and [GBMF4855](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855).

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) is a web and workshop based organization that is designed to teach basic computing concepts, skills, and tools for working with scientific data. The resources provided on this site are being developed in association with Data Carpentry.

#### Software Carpentry

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) has been teaching
scientists and engineers the concepts, skills, and tools they need to
use and build software more productively since 1977. All of the content
is freely available under a Creative Commons license (the same one we
use here), and the existence of this content not only saves me a massive
amount of time and effort, but also taught me a lot of what I know about
programming well.
