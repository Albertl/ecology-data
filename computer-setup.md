***WIS 6934 students will need their own laptops set up with R by week 2, Git by week 10, and SQL by week 13.***

### R

Download and install the [R base system](http://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Both are needed. Installing RStudio will not automatically install R.

### Git

#### Windows

1.  Download the Git for Windows
    [installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
2.  Run the installer and follow the steps bellow:
    1. Click on "Next".
    2. Click on "Next".
    3. Keep "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" selected and click on "Next". If you forgot to do this programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
    4. Click on "Next".
    5. Keep "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" selected and click on "Next".
    6. Keep "Use Windows' default console window" selected and click on "Next".
    7. Click on "Install".
    8. Click on "Finish".

#### Mac OS X

1. Open up the Terminal, type in "git" and press enter.
2. This should cause a pop-up window to appear. It will have several options;
   click on "Install" (not "Get Xcode").
3. Click "Agree".
4. When the install is finished, click "Done".
5. To make sure this worked, type in "git" in the Terminal and press enter. Some
   information will come up, including a list of common commands.

If this doesn't work you can try the following:

For **OS X 10.9 and higher**, install Git for Mac by downloading and running the
most recent "mavericks" installer from
[this list](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).  After
installing Git, there will not be anything in your `/Applications` folder, as
Git is a command line program. For older versions of **OS X (10.5-10.8)**
use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" [available
here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/.)

#### Linux

Git is probably already installed. If it is not already available install it via
your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install git`
and for Fedora run `sudo yum install git`.

### SQL

Download and install [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
### Python

*Python installation is not required for WIS 6934. Python materials on this site
are no longer under active development.*

Download and install the
[Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads).
I recommend you use a special editor like the [Wing Intelligent Development Environment - 101](http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101).
