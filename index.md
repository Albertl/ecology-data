This website hosts introductory material used by Ethan White's programming and database management courses and self-guided students anywhere. The online course offers instruction in basic programming for Python, R, and SQL. The materials were originally designed for biologists, but can be useful for any scientist working with computers. If you are interested in adapting this material for your own course, take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/ethanwhite/datacarp-semester-biology/blob/gh-pages/README.md). Thanks for visiting!

The goal of this courses is to teach biologists how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research. In
other words, the purpose of these courses is to teach you how to drive the car,
not prepare you to be a mechanic.

The development of these courses, and this site, have been supported by an
[NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694) intended
to improve the use of computational tools in biology. It is also my hope
developing these courses in an open and collaborative manner will make it
possible to team up with other like minded biologists and programmers to tackle
the challenge of training biologists to more effectively use available
computational resources. As part of this effort these course actively integrate
with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) and
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org).
