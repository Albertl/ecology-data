##Welcome!

This website hosts introductory material used by Ethan White's programming and database management course and self-guided students anywhere. The online course offers instruction in basic programming for SQL, R, and Python. The materials were originally designed for biologists, but can be useful for any scientist working with computers.

The goal of this course is to teach biologists how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research. In
other words, the purpose of this cours is to teach you how to drive the car,
not prepare you to be a mechanic.

The development of this course, and this site, have been supported by an
[NSF CAREER award](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0953694) and by 
the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery Initiative through 
grants [GBMF4563](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855) and [GBMF4855](https://www.moore.org/grants/list/GBMF4855). The funding sources broadly 
support the development of resources that improve data management and 
exploration in science. Along with the funding support, this course actively integrates with [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) and [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org). 
It is also my hope that developing this course in an open and collaborative manner will make it possible to team up with other like minded biologists and 
programmers to tackle the challenge of training biologists to more effectively 
use available computational resources.

Thanks for visiting!
