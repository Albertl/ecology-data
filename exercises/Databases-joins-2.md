You are curious about what other kinds of animals get caught in the
Sherman traps used to census the rodents. Write a query that the returns
a list of the scientific names and Taxa (from the species table) for
non-rodent individuals that are caught on the control plots. You are
only interested in which species are captured, so make this list unique
(only one line for each species). Save this query as `Non-rodents On
Controls`.
