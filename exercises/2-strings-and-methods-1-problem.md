Use string methods to print the following. Leave a blank line between
each answer. Start with the string provided and then use a method to
perform the task described.

-   'species' in all capital letters
-   'gcagtctgaggattccaccttctacctgggagagaggacatactatatcgcagcagtggaggtggaatgg'
    with all of the occurences of 'a' replaced with 'A'
-   "    Thank goodness it's Friday" without the leading white space
    (i.e., without the spaces before 'Thank')
-   The number of a's in
    'gccgatgtacatggaatatacttttcaggaaacacatatctgtggagagg'. You'll need a
    method that is not described in your book to do this easily. Look it
    up by typing help(str). [Hint: it starts with a 'c']
-   Print the length of this dna sequence
    'gccgatgtacatggaatatacttttcaggaaacacatatctgtggagagg' [Hint: this
    doesn't use a method, but the general function for determining the
    length of things len()]
