Write a series of print statements that returns the following (include a
blank line between each answer):

​a. Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

​b. What's up with scientists using all of this snooty latin?

​c. atgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgc

[Note: this is a series of 15 'atgc' values, so there is a much easier
way to do this than typing out the entire string].

​d. Darwin's "On the origin of species" is a seminal work in biology.

e.
