This is a follow-up to [R-SQL 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Sql-2-R).

Dr. Und√≥miel agrees with you that the difference in male and female *D. spectabilis* hind foot length and weight seems pretty small, but wants to have a 
reference point for comparison. She wants you to find the male and female hind 
foot length and weight for all species of rodent. 

1. Generate a list of all of the rodent `species_id` at Portal.
2. Write a function that generalizes the queries you used to select the 
average hind foot length and average weight of male and female *D. spectabilis*. 
Your function should take a `species_id` and use `paste()` to add it to the 
male and female queries. Combine the query results with `rbind()` into a data 
frame with `species_id`, `sex`, `avg_hindfoot_length`, and `avg_weight`. 
Your data frame should have two rows (*one row for each sex*).
3. Automate the query using your function and a `for` loop to cycle through the 
list of `species_id`.
4. Store the results in a combined data frame with 
`species_id`, `sex`, `avg_hindfoot_length`, and `avg_weight`.
