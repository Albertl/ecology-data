We want to do an analysis comparing the size of individuals on the
control plots to the Long-term Krat Exclosures. Write a query that
returns the `year`, `species`, `weight` and the `PlotTypeAlphaCode` for 
all cases `WHERE` the `PlotTypeDescript` is either `Control` or `Long-term Krat
Exclosure`. Save this query as `Size Comparison Controls vs. LT Krat
Exclosures`.
