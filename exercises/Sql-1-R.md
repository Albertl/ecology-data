This is a follow up to the [SQL Filtering]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Sql-filtering) problem.

It is clear Dr. Und√≥miel appreciates your skill working with large databases and 
she seems to expect you will maintain your benevolence. (*Such is a fair 
expectation of a true wizard*). This time though, she's looking for some extra 
detail in her queries. She's curious if desert rodents are [dimorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism) in size.
 

1. [Import]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Sql-importing-data) a fresh version of the [`Surveys` table](http://files.figshare.com/2292172/surveys.csv) 
to your `portal_mammals.sqlite` database. (*We may have updated it since your 
last download.*)  
2. Connect to `portal_mammals.sqlite` using the `RSQLite` package. 
3. From the `Surveys` table, `SELECT` and print out the average (`AVG()`) hind 
foot length and average weight of:
  - all *Dipodomys spectabilis* individuals
  - male *D. spectabilis*
  - female *D. spectabilis*.
