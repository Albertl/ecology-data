Write a function that converts pounds to grams (there are 453.592 in one
pound). Use that function and a built in function to print out how many
grams there are in 3.75 pounds, rounded to the nearest gram. Don't do
any printing or rounding inside your function, you want to keep it
simple, just have it do the conversion and then do the rounding and
printing outside of the function.
