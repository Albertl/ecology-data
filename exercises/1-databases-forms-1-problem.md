Download a copy of the [Portal
Database](http://www.programmingforbiologists.org/sites/programmingforbiologists.org/files/portal_database.accdb)
and create a basic data entry form for the species table. Since we would
only use this form to add new species to the table, do not include the
OldCode field in the form. Also, New Code isn't very clear for someone
entering data, so change the label on this field to Species Code. Save
this form as **Species Table Data Entry**.
