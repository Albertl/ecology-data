This is a follow up to [Writing Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-writing-functions-R).

Measuring things using the metric system is the standard approach for
scientists, but when communicating with your results more broadly it may be
useful to use different units (at least in some countries). Write a function
that converts kilograms into pounds (there are 2.205 pounds in a kilogram). Use
that function along with your dinosaur mass function to estimate the weight, in
pounds, of a 12 m long Stegosaurus (*12 m is about as big as they come and
nothing gets folks excited like a giant dinosaur*). In *Stegosauria*, `a` has
been estimated as `10.95` and `b` has been estimated as `2.64`
