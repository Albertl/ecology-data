Think about what value each of the following expressions will return?
Check your answers using the Python shell by typing each expression into
the shell and pressing enter.

​a. 2 - 10\
b. 3 \* 5\
c. 8 / 2\
d. 9 / 2\
e. 9.0 / 2\
f. 5 – 3 \* 2\
g. (5 – 3) \* 2\
h. 4 \*\* 2\
i. 8 / 2 \*\* 2

Did any of the results surprise you? If so, then you've probably run
into a common point of confusion in Python 2 - [Integer
Division](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/weecology/progbio/raw/master/ipynbs/integer-division.ipynb).

Now turn this set of expressions into a program that you can save by
using the editor. For each expression add one line to the editor as part
of a print statement to display the answer to the screen.

To tell someone reading the code what this section of the code is about,
add a comment line that says 'Problem 1' before the code that answers
the problem. Comments in Python are added by adding the \# sign.
Anything after a \# sign on the same line is ignored when the program is
run. So, the start of your program should look something like:

    # Problem 1
    print(2-10)
