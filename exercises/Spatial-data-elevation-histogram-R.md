A colleague of yours is working on a project on deer mice (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) and is interested in what elevations these mice tend to occupy in the continental United States. You offer to help them out by getting some coordinates for specimens of this species and looking up the elevation of these coordinates. 

1. Get deer mouse occurrences from GBIF, the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/), using the `spocc` R package, which is designed to retrieve species occurrence data from various openly available data resources.
