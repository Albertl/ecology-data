This is a follow up to the [Combining Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Combining-the-basics-R) exercise.

Dr. Granger wants you to run an ANOVA to determine if the different experimental 
treatments lead to differences in shrub carbon.

1. Import the data and your results table that you exported in 'Combining 
   Basics'.
2. Do an ANOVA to determine if the experiment has an influence on the shrub
   carbon and print out the results in a standard ANOVA table using
   `aov()`.
