This is a follow up to the [Functions 4
problem](http://www.programmingforbiologists.org/3-functions-4-problem).

Now that you've impressed Grandma, it's time to do some serious science.
Take the following list of Stegosaur lengths

    lengths = [10.1, 9.5, 11.2, 9.8, 10.4, 12.0, 11.5, 9.5, 9.8, 10.0, 10.7, 10.2, 11.9, 9.7, 11.2, 11.8, 10.7]

and estimate the mass in kilograms for each length using a for loop,
your function for estimating mass, a=10.95, and b=2.64. Print the
resulting list.
