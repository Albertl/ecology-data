Here is a small program that converts a mass in kilograms to a mass in grams and
then prints out the resulting value.

```
mass_kg <- 2.62
mass_g <- mass_kg * 1000
mass_g
```

1. Create a variable to store a body mass in pounds. Assign this variable a value of 3.5 (about the right size for a [Desert Cottontail Rabbit â€“ *Sylvilagus audubonii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Cottontail)).
2. Convert the variable from body mass in pounds to body mass in kilograms and assign it to a new variable.
Tip: You can do this by dividing the variable storing the weight in pounds by 2.20462. 
3. Print the value of the new variable to the screen.
