Write a series of print statements that returns the following (include a
blank line between each answer):

1. Post hoc ergo propter hoc
2. What's up with scientists using all of this snooty latin?
3. atgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgcatgc **Note: this is a series of 15 'atgc' values, so there is a much easier way to do this than typing out the entire string**.
4. Darwin's "On the origin of species" is a seminal work in biology.
