Use the built-in character functions `tolower` and `toupper` to manipulate the following strings.

1. `’species’` in all capital letters
2. return `’SPECIES’` to all lower case 

There are other built-in character functions in R, but they are surprisingly clunky and difficult to use. Lucky for us, someone else thought so too and built a package called `stringr`, that we introduce next.
