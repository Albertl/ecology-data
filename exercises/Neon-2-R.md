Jane just got a job working to develop data products for [NEON](neoninc.org). She's got to familiarize herself with working with LiDAR data and seeks out the great 'Work with Data' [tutorial for raster data](http://neondataskills.org/lidar-data/lidar-data-rasters-in-R/). Help Jane take the next step and develop a few additional products from the [LiDar Dataset](http://www.neonhighered.org/Data/LidarActivity/CHM_InSitu_Data.zip)

1. Modify the code provided in the tutorial to add the average chm value to the  plot centroids data.
