This is a follow up to the [Numpy 2 problem](numpy-2-problem).

Comparing the average masses of extant and extinct species was a good
start, but we really need to look at the full distributions of masses of
the two groups to get the best picture of whether or not there was a
major size bias in extinctions during the late Pleistocene. Make a graph
with a subplot for each region (or island type) that you think is worth
visualizing. Each subplot should contain two histograms that use the
same bins to display the number of extinct and extant species. Use the
log(mass) rather than the mass itself so that you can see the form of
the distributions more clearly. Label the axes appropriately. You may
find the optional argument alpha handy if you're trying to make things
look nice.
