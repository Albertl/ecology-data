Create a variable to store a body mass in pounds and assign it a value
of 3 (about the right size for a Desert Cottontail Rabbit â€“ Sylvilagus
audubonii). Convert this value to kilograms (we are serious scientists
after all). There are approximately 2.2046 lbs in a kilogram, so divide
the variable by 2.2046 and store this value in a new variable for
storing mass in kilograms. Print the value of the new variable to the
screen.
