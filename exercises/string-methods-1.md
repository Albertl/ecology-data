Use string methods to print the following. Leave a blank line between
each answer. Start with the string provided and then use a method to
perform the task described.

1. `species` in all capital letters
2. `gcagtctgaggattccaccttctacctgggagagaggacatactatatcgcagcagtggaggtggaatgg`
    with all of the occurences of `a` replaced with `A`
3.  "    Thank goodness it's Friday" without the leading white space
    (i.e., without the spaces before `Thank`)
4.  The number of a's in
    `gccgatgtacatggaatatacttttcaggaaacacatatctgtggagagg`. You'll need a
    method that is not described in your book to do this easily. Look it
    up by typing help(str). [Hint: it starts with a `c`]
5.  Print the length of this dna sequence
    `gccgatgtacatggaatatacttttcaggaaacacatatctgtggagagg` [Hint: this
    doesn`t use a method, but the general function for determining the
    length of things len()]
