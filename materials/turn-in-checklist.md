title: Turn in Checklist

### Turn in checklist

#### Clean up your code 
- Only include code and comments necessary for the running the assignment. Remove anything else (e.g., notes taken during class, commented code that isn't needed anymore).
- Clearly label problems using comments.

#### Make sure your code runs like you think it does
- Code should run from the start of the file to the end of the file without problems.
- Clear the R environment when making sure your code works. Many people in the past have lost points for mistakes they would have caught by doing this.

#### Work with data files appropriately
- Do not use setwd(). Ever. I don't even want to see it in commented code.
- Use relative paths, NOT absolute paths. I do not have a C drive; if you load a file using code that has "C:\..." in it, then your code will not run.
- Make sure the names of your files match the names in your code exactly. Windows is not case-sensititive with file names, but other computers sometimes are (including mine).
- Remove extra/duplicate files. Only turn in what is necessary for the assignment.
