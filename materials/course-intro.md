title: Course Introduction
---

### Welcome

* Introduce yourself (include your pronouns)
* Introduce co-instructors/TAs
* Depending on class size have students introduce themselves

### Course goals

* Data and how to work with it
* Data entry -> Data storage -> Data manipulation -> Data visualization
* Not statistics or machine learning

### Teaching methods (normal year)

* Flipped classroom
    * You don't learn how ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it
      and the same is true for computing
    * So we use a fair bit of class time for working on exercises, asking questions, and getting help
* Reading or videos before class
* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
	* You will work on additional exercises on your own (both in & out of class)
* Peer instruction
    * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from me
    * If you already know some of the material and are getting ahead, see if
      there's someone you can help
	* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know

### How to do this online (for 2020)

* But, it's 2020, and nothing is normal
* It has been a long, exhausting, year and it will continue to be so for many of us.
* My goal is to help you learn as much as you can, while recognizing that most of you have more limitations and less energy than usual.

* The course is being taught online for the first time due to the pandemic.
* Building the race car as it drives around the track.
* Videos in place live demos, which means they can also replace advanced readings/videos
* Still short presentations interspersed with exercises
* Class time will start with time for group Q&A focused on general questions about how things work
* The rest of class will be reserved for working on exercises and getting help
* To participate in class
    * Join the appropriate Zoom meeting (there a different Zoom links for Tuesdays and Fridays)
    * Ask questions via chat or by raising your hand during group Q&A
    * After group Q&A Andrew & I will use breakout rooms to meet with individual students or groups of students
* To provide maximum flexibility the course material can be engaged with in three ways:
    1. Fully synchronous: Attend class during the scheduled class periods. Follow each lesson, which combine video lectures and exercises, during the class periods and ask for help as you run into questions. This is the closest approximation to how the course normally runs in-person.
    2. Synchronous Q&A: Follow each lesson before class, watching the videos and doing the exercises you can. Stop if you get confused. Come to class during the class periods and ask for help on challenges you encountered.
    3. Asynchronous: Follow the lessons online and ask for help via Piazza. This is the least ideal approach because the course is generally based around the benefits of direct student-instructor interaction to work through misunderstandings, but we'll do our best to make it work for you.

* Piazza

* We have flexible deadline policies to support learning under these difficult circumstances.
There is an automatic (no request needed) 48 hour extension on all assignments for those who need it and if you need more time just let me know.
You never need to disclose personal information to me to get an extension. Just let me know how long you need.

* That said, I encourage you to keep up with deadlines to the extent possible.
Each step of the course builds on the last step and students who get behind often have a hard time catching up.

Class sessions will not be recorded to improve student privacy.

* If you have decent internet access the course is designed so that you can do it entirely in a browswer without any local software installation
* There are alternative approaches for folks with limited internet access
* Aid-a-Gator can also be used to help cover the cost of internet access

### Course structure

* Weekly assignments
    * Practice is really important for learning skills like this
    * Work on exercises in class
	* Will require additional programming time after class
	* Due end of the day on Monday

### Expected background

* Assumes no background in R or any of the other things we'll learn
* If you're already good at R it's worth spending some time with the website
  (which we're about to look at) to see if this a good fit for you
* Information on more advanced options

### Website

*Walk through the website showing the following items*

* Schedule
    * Walk through schedule (quickly)
* Readings
    * Read before relevant class
    * No need to do any challenges or exercises in readings
* Lessons
    * Alternating short videos (to introduce idea) and exercise (to start using that idea)
    * Whether you are treating the class as synchronous or asynchronous alternating between video and exercise will be most effective for most of you
* Lectures
    * Lectures notes used in class
	* Not expected to read in advance; may be useful for review
	* May not match lecture precisely
* Assignments
    * Answers provided

### Syllabus

* Grading
    * Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
    * Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect answer: 90%
    * Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept: 50%
    * No answer or answer lacking basic understanding of core concept: 0%
* Give it a read and let me know if you have any questions

### Office Hours

* Tuesday & Wednesday: 2-3 pm

### Canvas

* Handle grading and assignment submission through Canvas
* Chat

### First day demo

* With the little time we have left I just want to do a quick demo of some of
  the things you'll be able to do by the time we're half way through the class
